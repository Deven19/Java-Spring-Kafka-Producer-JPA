Step 1: Install Homebrew
Open your terminal and run the following command to install Homebrew:

bash
Copy code
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
After the installation is complete, add Homebrew to your PATH. Follow the instructions provided by the installation script, or run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
Step 2: Install Zookeeper and Kafka
Now that Homebrew is installed, you can use it to install Zookeeper and Kafka.

Install Zookeeper:
bash
Copy code
brew install zookeeper
Install Kafka:
bash
Copy code
brew install kafka
Step 3: Start Zookeeper
Start the Zookeeper server:

bash
Copy code
brew services start zookeeper
Alternatively, you can start it manually:

bash
Copy code
zookeeper-server-start /opt/homebrew/etc/zookeeper/zoo.cfg
Step 4: Start Kafka
Start the Kafka server:

bash
Copy code
brew services start kafka
Alternatively, you can start it manually:

bash
Copy code
kafka-server-start /opt/homebrew/etc/kafka/server.properties
Step 5: Verify Kafka and Zookeeper
Ensure both Kafka and Zookeeper are running. You can check the status using:

bash
Copy code
brew services list
Step 6: Create a Topic
Once both Zookeeper and Kafka are running, create a Kafka topic to verify the setup:

bash
Copy code
kafka-topics --create --topic test-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
Step 7: Update Spring Boot Configuration
Ensure your Spring Boot application is configured to connect to the Kafka broker correctly. Update the application.properties or application.yml file:

yaml
Copy code
spring:
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: localhost:9092
    producer:
      key-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
      value-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
Step 8: Restart Spring Boot Application
Restart your Spring Boot producer application and try sending a message again.

Additional Troubleshooting Steps
Check Kafka Logs: Look for any errors or warnings in the Kafka server logs. The logs are typically located in /usr/local/var/log/kafka if installed via Homebrew.

Check Network Connectivity: Ensure there are no network issues or firewalls blocking the connection to localhost:9092.

Verify Kafka and Zookeeper Ports: Ensure that Kafka is running on the default port (9092) and Zookeeper on (2181). You can check and modify these ports in the server.properties (Kafka) and zoo.cfg (Zookeeper) configuration files.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up and run Zookeeper and Kafka on your Mac, allowing your Spring Boot producer application to connect to Kafka successfully. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please let me know!
